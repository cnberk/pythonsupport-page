Environments
============

.. include:: /_rst_includes/tip-copy.rst

Python environments are isolated spaces where you can manage separate sets of packages for different projects. 
This helps avoid conflicts that arise when different projects require different versions of the 
same package. For example, one project might need require ``numpy==1.23``, while another may require ``numpy==1.25``. If these versions 
are not compatible, switching back and forth between them for different 
projects can become quite annoying. Instead of reinstalling the correct version each time you switch projects, 
it is possible to use environments which allows you to keep fully functional and separate
package lists and easily swap between them.

.. tip:: 
    If you do not know what packages are, please check the description at the Packages section.

Python environments allow you to maintain separate sets of packages, making it easy to switch between 
completely different configurations without conflict. Using environments can be used for a variety of things:

1. Quickly testing whether certain packages conflicts
2. Checking whether a developed Python script is compatible with different package versions
3. Ensuring a minimal package list (no unused packages)
4. Maintaining multiple functional package environments

It is recommended to create a separate environment for each course or project to ensure 
that their requirements do not interfere with each other.

Conda lets users create separate sets of packages for different projects, which are called **environments**. 
When users switch between projects, they can switch to the environment of that project, which would prevent the need to 
manage packages each time a different project is used. The Conda manager also allows you to create and manage 
environments with specific packages and different Python versions. This can be useful if a specific
package requires a specific Python version.

.. note::

    A global environment, created using --name, is stored in Conda's default directory. By creating your environment 
    in the global environment list, it will be easy for you to activate just the environment name, and centrally manage 
    all your environments. A subdirectory environment, created using --prefix, is stored within a specific project 
    directory, which would keep the environment self-contained within your project. Therefore, if 
    you wish to deliver the environment you used along with your code, you should create a subdirectory environment.

Creating an environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an example, let's create an environment with Conda for Course A. An environment can be created by using:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell

         # create an environment named 'course-A' (in the global environment list)
         conda create --name course-A
         # alternatively, the environment can be placed in a subdirectory
         conda create --prefix course-A

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         # create an environment named 'course-A' (in the global environment list)
         conda create --name course-A
         # alternatively, the environment can be placed in a subdirectory
         conda create --prefix course-A

.. note::
   
   One can list the available *global* environments (created with ``--name``)
   by executing ``conda env list``.


Activating an environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the environment is created, one can use the environment by *activating* it.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell
        
         # if the enviroment was created with --name:
         conda activate course-A
         # if the environment was created in a sub directory (--prefix):
         conda activate .\course-A

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         # if the enviroment was created with --name:
         conda activate course-A
         # if the environment was created in a sub directory (--prefix):
         conda activate ./course-A

Once an environment has been created and sourced (activated), all ``python`` commands only act in *that environment*.

Now every executed Python script will only use the packages installed
in the environment. To get out of the environment, simply run the command ``conda deactivate``.

Example environment management with Conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is a complete example of creating an environment using a specific Python
version, installing a specific package, running a code using the environment, and getting out of it.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell

         conda create --name numpy-env python=3.10
         conda activate numpy-env
         conda install "numpy=1.23"
         python -c "import numpy as np ; print(np.__version__)"
         conda deactivate

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda create --name numpy-env python=3.10
         conda activate numpy-env
         conda install "numpy=1.23"
         python3 -c "import numpy as np ; print(np.__version__)"
         conda deactivate

This code creates a new Conda environment named numpy-env with Python 3.10 installed. It then 
activates the environment and installs version 1.23 of the Numpy library. After installation, 
it runs a Python command to import NumPy and print the installed version of Numpy to verify the installation. 
Finally, the environment is deactivated, returning the user to their previous environment or base environment.

Environments with venv
----------------------

Wwhile Conda offers powerful tools for managing complex environments and dependencies, there are 
situations where **venv** might be more suitable. venv is ideal for simpler projects that only require 
Python packages, as it is lightweight and easy to use. It is built into Python, so it doesn not require 
any additional installation, making it convenient for managing environments directly tied to the system's Python.

Using venv in VS Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VS Code helps managing virtual environments through some built-in commands. 
Here is a brief explanation on how to set up a virtual environment in VS Code:

First, check that you are already in a virtual environment (see point 5 below). If not, proceed to the next step.

1. Create a folder/directory according to the course you wish to work on.
   
   *This is optional but helps keep your projects organized.*.

2. Press :guilabel:`Open Folder` to start working in the designated course
   folder. If you already have several opened folders, this will not be
   visible. Just select the workspace.

      :width: 700
      :align: center
      :alt: Open folder in VS Code

3. Once you are in a folder/workspace we should create a virtual
   environment. Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for
   ``Python: Create Environment...``, and select that.

4. Next, select the option below:

      :width: 600
      :align: center
      :alt: VS Code venv creation

5. Check that the virtual environment is functional. Sometimes you need
   to run a small Python script to enable the virtual environment,
   either press :fas:`arrow-right`, or :kbd:`Shift-Enter`

Using venv in the Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The package venv creates environments using the pip method. Once an environment has been created and 
sourced (activated), all pip commands only act within that environment.

.. tip:: 
    If you do not know what pip is, please check the description at the section on pip.

.. note::

    The ``venv`` package can only create environments with different packages.
    It cannot switch between different Python versions.

    An environment will be a directory on your computer. Deleting
    it will be the same as deleting the environment.

.. warning::
   Environments in :ref:`ide-vscode` requires special handling when
   working in workspaces. Please see :ref:`here <faq-vscode-venv-workspace>`.


An environment can be created using:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell

         python -m venv <path to venv>
         # create an environment named 'course-A' in the current directory
         python -m venv course-A

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m venv <path to venv>
         # create an environment named 'course-A' in the current directory
         python3 -m venv course-A

Once created, one can *activate*/use the environment by *sourcing* a file.
Change ``course-A`` with the name of the environment.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. warning::
         Please see :ref:`this FAQ entry <faq-win-ps-execution-policy>`!

      .. code-block:: powershell

         course-A\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         source course-A/bin/activate


Now, every executed Python script will only use the packages installed
in the environment, and every ``pip`` command will only install/remove packages
in the environment. To exit the environment, simply run the command ``deactivate``.

Below is an example workflow of creating an environment, installing a specific
package, running a code using the environment, and exiting the environment.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell

         python -m venv numpy-env
         numpy-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
         pip install "numpy==1.23.*"
         python -c "import numpy as np ; print(np.__version__)"
         deactivate

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m venv numpy-env
         source numpy-env/bin/activate
         pip install "numpy==1.23.*"
         python3 -c "import numpy as np ; print(np.__version__)"
         deactivate

This code creates a Python virtual environment called numpy-env using venv, then activates 
it to install version 1.23 of Numpy using pip. After installing, it verifies 
the installation by printing the installed Numpy version. Finally, the environment is deactivated, 
returning the user to their previous environment or base environment.

Using Virtual Environments with Jupyter/IPython
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jupyter Notebooks and IPython are interactive computing environments that 
enable users to write and execute code in a notebook format. These notebooks 
can combine code, text, and visualizations. The usage of Jupyter notebooks are 
common in many computing-related tasks of the courses at DTU.

Virtual environments and Jupyter can cause issues when Jupyter is installed in the
system (not in the virtual environment). The kernel is fixed to launch
the Python interpreter it got installed with. Kernel is a process that allows you to 
execute the code in your Jupyter notebook by providing the necessary Python languge support.

The simplest way to check whether your Jupyter Notebook is using your virtual environment
is to execute the following code in a notebook cell:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   print(sys.exec_prefix)

If it shows the directory of your virtual environment, you are all 
set. If not, install the kernel runner in the virtual environment:


.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ win_powershell }}
      :sync: powershell

      .. code-block:: powershell

         python -m ipykernel install --prefix <path to venv|conda-env>

   .. tab-item:: {{ mac_bash }}
      :sync: mac

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m ipykernel install --prefix <path to venv|conda-env>

Replace <path to venv|conda-env> with the path to your virtual environment. 
The problem and the fix is described in greater detail
`here <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html>`__.
